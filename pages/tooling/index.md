* [lookup-license](https://github.com/hesa/lookup-license/) - Python tool to identify license from license text or license name. Basically wraps [ScanCode](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/) and [FOSS Licenses](https://github.com/hesa/foss-licenses)
* [ORT](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort) - A suite of tools to automate software compliance checks
* [ScanCode](https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/) - ScanCode detects licenses, copyrights, dependencies by "scanning code" 
* [Scarfer](https://github.com/hesa/scarfer) - Source Code scan report file reporter

## License databases

* [FOSS Licenses](https://github.com/hesa/foss-licenses) - License meta data: data and python module/cli
* [LDBcollector](https://github.com/maxhbr/LDBcollector) - A small application which needs a better name and collects oss-license metadata and combines it
* [scancode-licensedb](https://scancode-licensedb.aboutcode.org/) - A free and open database of all the licenses, in particular all the open source software licenses
* [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/) - The SPDX License List includes a standardized short identifier, the full name, the license text, and a canonical permanent URL for each license and exception. 

## License compatibility

### Tools

* [flict](https://github.com/vinland-technology/flict) -  free and open source software license compatibility tool
* [FOSS Licenses](https://github.com/hesa/foss-licenses) - License meta data: data and python module/cli
